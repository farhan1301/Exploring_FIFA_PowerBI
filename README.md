# Exploring FIFA Men's World Cup Data in Power BI 

## Overview
This Power BI project provides an analysis of the FIFA Men's World Cup history, focusing on key metrics and questions related to team performances and historical trends. Using a subset of the Fjeldstul World Cup database, which spans all World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2018, I have created visualizations and insights to address several key questions.

## Data
The analysis uses a subset of data from the Fjeldstul World Cup database, a comprehensive database about all World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2018. The database contains 27 datasets, but for the analysis, I'm using 5.

## Key Questions
* Which country scored the most goals?
* Which country reached the most finals?
* Which year did teams score the most goals?
* Is there an advantage for the host country?

## Data Model
The data model includes the following tables:
* Tournaments
* Teams
* Team Appearances
* Matches
* Goals
These tables are interconnected to allow for comprehensive analysis and insightful visualizations.
